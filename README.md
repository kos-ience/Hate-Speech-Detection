An automated system to detect and classify hate speech is an urgent need to improve the security and safeguard the cyber world. In this paper we study different classification method to detect hate speech. This paper proposes to use logistic regression, Bi-LSTM and neural network with attention, to predict hate speeches in twitter. We try to create models which incorporate contexts of the tweets and compare traditional models to these untraditional models. The Sentiment 140 dataset is used for the study. A random sample from the data is used for the entire study. Traditional models like Logistic regression, SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest are built and compared with deep lea ring models like CNN, RNN, LSTM, Bi-LSTM. CNN model turned out to have an accuracy of 82%. Moreover, deep neural networks with attention were built using a BERT model. A further adjustment for the BERT model by including CNN layers to it gave as the highest accuracy of 93% among all the other models.
